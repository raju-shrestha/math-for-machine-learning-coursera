# Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization
This repo contains all my work for [this specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning). The courses covers basic mathematics for understandin machine leraning and data science. Highly recommend anyone wanting to master machine learning or data science.

All the code, quiz questions, and images are from the specialization. Here I posted these solutions, which are only for your reference purpse and for saving your time.
